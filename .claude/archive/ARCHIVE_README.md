# Archived Specs

This folder contains archived specification systems that have been superseded.

## openspec-archived/ (Archived: 2026-02-02)

The OpenSpec change-based specification system was used during development of:
- Warehouse hierarchy
- Batch operations (receiving, transfer, issuing)
- Lot lifecycle management
- QR label printing and scanner integration
- Inventory stocktake
- Component showcase updates

**Reason for archiving:** All features have been consolidated into `.claude/specs/kho-chi/` which now serves as the canonical warehouse management specification.
